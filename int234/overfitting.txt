//Underfitting and overfitting are two common challenges faced in machine learning

Over Fitting: occurs when a model is too complex and memorizes the training data too well. This leads to good performance on the training set but poor performance on the test set.

Under Fitting: Underfitting happens when a model is not good enough to understand all the details in the data. Itâ€™s like the model is too simple and misses important stuff.. This leads to poor performance on both the training and test sets
